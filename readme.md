# video-background-using-html5
Simple demo to show how to display a video as your background image on a website with HTML5,
I've added the correctly formatted video files for each browser and if on a older browser it will simple show the image provided.<br/>

Due to a server change I removed the videos files from my server for a temporary time, I've now added these back again so the demo will display correctly.
